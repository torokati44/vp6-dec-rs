# License

Most files in this project are under the GNU Lesser General Public License
version 2.1 or later (LGPL v2.1+). Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv2.1` for details.

One exception is `qsort.c` which is under the MIT license.

In combination the LGPL v2.1+ applies to this project.

_(NOTE: In the future, a mechanism might be added to autodetect an FFmpeg installation on the host system at build time, and if a usable one is found, not compile in any part of its code statically, but link to its existing libraries dynamically. In that scenario, the license of this project could be switched to something else, like MIT or Apache. This is not yet possible however.)_
